This project is a small project developed using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It does not use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for data flow so far.

The goal of this project is to consume the Reddit API to get access to the posts in the [funny subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/) and then show the first 30 posts. The UI is responsive for mobile and desktop.
